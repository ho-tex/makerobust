\maketitle

Heiko Oberdiek's \textsf{makerobust} package defined a command with name
\verb|\MakeRobustCommand| that can be used to make fragile commands
robust.

The \LaTeX\ format has, since 2015, included a command
\verb|\MakeRobust| with the same syntax and behaviour.  Also by 2019,
almost all commands in \LaTeX\ that may be used in a moving argument
are already robust.

This package is now just a simple one line package defining the name 
\verb|\MakeRobustCommand| as an alias for \verb|\MakeRobust|, and
should not be used in new documents.
